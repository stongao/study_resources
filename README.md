# Interview Portfolio

I am Sushant Tongaonkar, graduate student at NC State university, specializing in Computer Networks. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities as Software Development or Test Engineer in the domain of Computer Networks, Cloud computing or system security. This is the repo I am maintaining as I prepare for the interviews to keep may notes, resources, pracice programs and to track my progress.  
Over next few weeks I plan to study and revise basic requuired skiils for computer scientists and engineers.
- Programming Languages
- Data Structure
- Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- Computer Networks

I will try to incorporate a good mix of above domains in my daily preparation. My current plan is to write code for practice problems involving atleast :
- Any 3 of the basic data structures, 1 from each group: 
  * arrays, strings, stack, queue
  * Linked list, Binary trees, BST
  * hash table, heap, priority queues
- atleast 1 problem involving dynamic programming
- atleast 1 problem involving graph algorithms
- atleast 1 problem involving backtracking/recursion  
  
Apart from that I will try to study some specific topic and make a note everyday for topics around
- Operating systems
- Computer Networks
- Programming languages and compilers

I will be using [this](https://github.com/tSushant/interview_portfolio/blob/master/schedule.md) schedule to plan and track my progress.

## Preparation plan

### C/C++ Programming

- Topics
- C programming books


### Data structures
Study STL constructs and APIs, how is it implemented, what does compiler do when called specific API, complexities, limitations, how could sloppy code break it, how to use efficiently
- arrays
  * Contiguous memory
  * vector vs array
  * uses in other data structs
  * stride length
- linked lists
  * Dynamic memory and applications
  * Ways to improve efficiency
- stacks
  * Implementation with array vs list
  * Common uses
- queues
  * Implementation with array vs list
  * Common uses
- priority queues
  * heap with array vs tree
  * heapify
  * heapsort
  * comparators
- binary tree
- binary search tree
- hash table
  * map, unordered_map
  * hash functions
  * buckets
  * collisions and complexity

### Algorithms

- Big-o notation
- Master theorem
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Sorting
- Searching
- Dynamic programming
- Graph Algorithms

### Operating systems

- Process
- Threads
- Multithreading and concurrancy
- Memory management
- I/O management

### Networking

- Network stack
- Layer 2 networks
  * Switching and forwarding
  * Collision, Broadcast domains, VLANS
  * Loops, Spanning Tree Protocol
  * Link aggregation
  * MPLS
  * Lossless ethernet
- Layer 2 networks
  * IP header
  * IP addressing
  * Routing tables, longest prefix match
  * Routing protocols
  * OSPF
  * BGP
