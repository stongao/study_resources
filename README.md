## Preparation plan

### C/C++ Programming

- Topics
- C programming books


### Data structures
Study STL constructs and APIs, how is it implemented, what does compiler do when called specific API, complexities, limitations, how could sloppy code break it, how to use efficiently
- arrays
  * Contiguous memory
  * vector vs array
  * uses in other data structs
  * stride length
- linked lists
  * Dynamic memory and applications
  * Ways to improve efficiency
- stacks
  * Implementation with array vs list
  * Common uses
- queues
  * Implementation with array vs list
  * Common uses
- priority queues
  * heap with array vs tree
  * heapify
  * heapsort
  * comparators
- binary tree
- binary search tree
- hash table
  * map, unordered_map
  * hash functions
  * buckets
  * collisions and complexity

### Algorithms

- Big-o notation
- Master theorem
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Sorting
- Searching
- Dynamic programming
- Graph Algorithms

### Operating systems

- Process
- Threads
- Multithreading and concurrancy
- Memory management
- I/O management

### Networking

- Network stack
- Layer 2 networks
  * Switching and forwarding
  * Collision, Broadcast domains, VLANS
  * Loops, Spanning Tree Protocol
  * Link aggregation
  * MPLS
  * Lossless ethernet
- Layer 2 networks
  * IP header
  * IP addressing
  * Routing tables, longest prefix match
  * Routing protocols
  * OSPF
  * BGP
