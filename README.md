# Interview Portfolio

I am Sushant Tongaonkar, graduate student at NC State university, specializing in Computer Networks. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities as Software Development or Test Engineer in the domain of Computer Networks, Cloud computing or system security. This is the repo I am maintaining as I prepare for the interviews to keep may notes, resources, pracice programs and to track my progress.  
Over next few weeks I plan to study and revise basic requuired skiils for computer scientists and engineers.
- Programming Languages
- Data Structure
- Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- Computer Networks

I will try to incorporate a good mix of above domains in my daily preparation. My current plan is to write code for practice problems involving atleast :
- Any 3 of the basic data structures, 1 from each group: 

| arrays, strings, stack, queue | Linked list, Binary trees, BST | hash table, heap, priority queues |
|----|----|----|

- atleast 1 problem involving dynamic programming
- atleast 1 problem involving graph algorithms
- atleast 1 problem involving backtracking/recursion  
  
Apart from that I will try to study some specific topic and make a note everyday for topics around
- Operating systems
- Computer Networks
- Programming languages and compilers

I will be using [this](https://github.com/tSushant/interview_portfolio/blob/master/schedule.md) schedule to plan and track my progress.
